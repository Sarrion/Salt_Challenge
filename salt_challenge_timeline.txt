Two files containing the training data has been created. 
 - "images.npy" contains each image as a row, images has been converted into an
  array of floats representing grey tonalities.
 - "targets.npy" contains the covers (or targets) of each images, codified as
  0s or 1s.

One script called "neuralTry1.py" that builds a NN has been coded.

A first tensorboard has been utilized, we can do that by creating a logfile and 
reading it by means of cmd command:
    tensorboard --logdir=C:\Users\avicent\Documents\GitHub\Salt_Challenge\logs
     --host=127.0.0.1
Then, we can open the tensorboard by introducing the address returned in a web
browser.

A new folder called "models" has been created. This folder will save generated
models and the code that generates them. The code used to save models is:
    saver = tf.train.Saver()
    saver.save(sess, "./models/model1/model1.ckpt")
To recover a model we can use:
    saver = tf.train.Saver()
    saver.restore(sess, "./models/model1/model1.ckpt")
More information in: "https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/saved_model".

An error during model3 training has been occured, see the "model3_code.py" file 
in "./Salt_Challenge/models/model3".

Regenerated model3 without the problem, this was because there was less test 
data than training data, and within the loop the testLoss couldnÂ´t be generated
from iteration 800.
