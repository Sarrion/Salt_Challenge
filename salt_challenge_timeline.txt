A first tensorboard has been utilized, we can do that by creating a logfile and 
reading it by means of cmd command:
    tensorboard --logdir=C:\Users\avicent\Documents\GitHub\Salt_Challenge\logs
     --host=127.0.0.1
Then, we can open the tensorboard by introducing the address returned in a web
browser.
